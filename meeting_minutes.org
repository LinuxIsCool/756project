** I Will investigate ES, they will do RL
 We will solve some benchmark problems with our respective algorithms by next Tuesday.

ES is for training Neural Networks
Virtual Batch normalization is important
Communication strategies based on random numbers
ES exhibits better exploration than TRPO
Robust - fixed hyper parameters
