* Tuesday, March 21st Worksession
** Installing Gym
Namita and Sethu are installing gym
** I Will investigate ES, they will do RL
 We will solve some benchmark problems with our respective algorithms by next Tuesday.
** Notes on ES implementation
ES is for training Neural Networks
Virtual Batch normalization is important
Communication strategies based on random numbers
ES exhibits better exploration than TRPO
Robust - fixed hyper parameters
** Evolution Strategies
At every iteration ("generation"), a population of parameter vectors ("genotypes")
is perturbed ("mutated") and their objective function value ("fitness") is evaluated.
The highest scoring parameter vectors are then recombined ("breeded") to form the 
population for the next generation.

Algorithms differ by how they represent the population and how they perform mutation
and recombination.
